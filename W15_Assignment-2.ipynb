    "R-squared, often denoted as R², is a statistical measure used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. \n",
    "It provides insight into how well the independent variable(s) in your linear regression model explain the variation in the dependent variable. \n",
    "In simpler terms, R-squared tells you how well your model fits the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of R-squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation:\n",
    "    R-squared is calculated as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Y) that is explained by the independent variable(s) \n",
    "    (X) in your linear regression model. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "        R² = 1 - (SSR / SST)\n",
    "\n",
    "    SSR (Sum of Squared Residuals): \n",
    "        This represents the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values (obtained from the regression model) and the actual\n",
    "        observed values of the dependent variable.\n",
    "    SST (Total Sum of Squares): \n",
    "        This represents the sum of the squared differences between the actual observed values of the dependent variable and the mean of the \n",
    "        dependent variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In other words, R-squared measures the proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the regression model.\n",
    "    A higher R-squared value indicates that a larger proportion of the variation is explained by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared values range from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%).\n",
    "R-squared = 0 indicates that the independent variable(s) do not explain any variation in the dependent variable, and the model does not fit the \n",
    "data.\n",
    "R-squared = 1 indicates that the independent variable(s) perfectly explain all the variation in the dependent variable, and the model fits the \n",
    "data perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A high R-squared value (close to 1) suggests that the independent variable(s) are good predictors of the dependent variable, and the model \n",
    "    does a good job of explaining the variation in the data.\n",
    "    A low R-squared value (close to 0) suggests that the independent variable(s) do not provide much information about the dependent variable,\n",
    "    and the model may not be a good fit for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared does not tell you whether the coefficients of the independent variables are statistically significant.\n",
    "R-squared can be artificially inflated by adding more independent variables to the model, even if they are not meaningful predictors.\n",
    "R-squared does not indicate the causality of the relationships between variables; it only measures the strength of the linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, R-squared is a useful tool for assessing the goodness of fit of a linear regression model and understanding how well the independent \n",
    "variable(s) explain the variation in the dependent variable. However, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools and domain \n",
    "knowledge to draw meaningful conclusions about the model's performance and the relationships between variables."

    "    n is the number of observations (data points).\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A higher R²_adj indicates a better model fit, but it also reflects the trade-off between model complexity (the number of predictors) and\n",

    "by the model. Here's an explanation of each metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual (observed) values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a straightforward and interpretable measure of the model's prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE = (1 / n) * Σ|Yᵢ - Ŷᵢ|\n",
    "\n",
    "Yᵢ: Actual (observed) value for the i-th data point.\n",
    "Ŷᵢ: Predicted value for the i-th data point.\n",

    "MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Squaring the errors gives more weight to larger errors, making it sensitive to outliers.\n",

    "MSE is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE = (1 / n) * Σ(Yᵢ - Ŷᵢ)²\n",

    "Yᵢ: Actual (observed) value for the i-th data point.\n",

    "RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides a measure of the standard deviation of the prediction errors.\n",

    "All three metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) are used to quantify the prediction accuracy of a regression model.\n",

    "    It is a commonly used metric, making it easy to compare models and communicate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    RMSE is sensitive to outliers, which means that extreme values in the dataset can disproportionately influence the metric. This sensitivity \n",
    "    may not be desirable in cases where outliers are expected or important.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It can be biased by the scale of the dependent variable, making it less suitable for comparing models with different units of measurement or\n",

    "    It has the same disadvantages related to scale as RMSE, making it less suitable for comparing models with different units of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. MAE (Mean Absolute Error):\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    MAE is robust to outliers because it measures the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values. Outliers have a linear,\n",
    "    rather than quadratic, impact on this metric.\n",
    "    It is more interpretable than MSE and RMSE because it directly represents the average prediction error in the same units as the dependent \n",
    "    variable.\n",
    "    MAE can be a better choice when outliers are expected or when you want to prioritize minimizing moderate errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    MAE does not give larger errors more weight, which may not be suitable when you want to strongly penalize significant deviations.\n",
    "    It may not provide as clear of a picture of the overall prediction accuracy as RMSE or MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice of which metric to use in regression analysis depends on the specific characteristics of your problem and your modeling \n",

    "\n",
    "Regularization Strength: \n",
    "    Regularization introduces a hyperparameter (e.g., λ in Ridge and Lasso) that controls the strength of the penalty. A larger value of λ leads\n",

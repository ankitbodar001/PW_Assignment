    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98558614305052 is very close to 1, which suggests an extremely strong positive linear relationship\n",
    "between the number of sales calls made per day and the number of sales made per week. This means that as the number of sales calls made per day \n",
    "increases, there is a very strong tendency for the number of sales made per week to increase as well. Similarly, as the number of sales calls \n",
    "decreases, the number of sales made per week tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value being close to 1 indicates that the relationship between these two variables is highly linear and that they move in almost perfect \n",
    "sync. This strong correlation suggests that the number of sales calls made per day is a very reliable predictor of the number of sales made per \n",
    "week in this context."

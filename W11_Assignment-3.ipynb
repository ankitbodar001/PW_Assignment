    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating unknown population parameters based on sample\n",
    "data. When dealing with real-world data, it is often not feasible or practical to collect data from an entire population. Instead, statisticians use \n",
    "estimation techniques to infer information about the population based on a smaller representative sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of estimation in statistics: point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate:\n",
    "    A point estimate is a single numerical value that serves as an estimate of an unknown population parameter. It is calculated from the sample data and\n",
    "    is used as the best guess for the value of the corresponding population parameter.\n",
    "    For example, if we want to estimate the population mean, we can calculate the sample mean and use it as the point estimate for the population mean. \n",
    "    Similarly, if we want to estimate the population proportion, we can calculate the sample proportion and use it as the point estimate for the population \n",
    "    proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simplicity: Point estimates are easy to calculate and understand.\n",
    "    Quick decision-making: They provide a quick and straightforward estimate of the parameter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Subject to sampling variability: Point estimates are based on sample data and can vary from one sample to another.\n",
    "    Lack of precision: Point estimates do not provide information about the uncertainty or precision of the estimate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Interval Estimate (Confidence Interval):\n",
    "    Interval estimation provides a range of plausible values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie with a certain degree of confidence.\n",
    "    This range is called the confidence interval, and it quantifies the uncertainty associated with the estimation process.\n",
    "    To construct a confidence interval, statisticians specify a confidence level, typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 90%, 95%, or 99%). The \n",
    "    confidence level represents the probability that the true population parameter lies within the calculated interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The confidence interval is built around the point estimate, and its width depends on the variability in the sample data and the chosen confidence level. \n",
    "    The wider the confidence interval, the more uncertainty there is about the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Provides information about precision: Confidence intervals give us an idea of how accurate our estimate is likely to be.\n",
    "    Accounts for sampling variability: By providing a range, it addresses the inherent uncertainty in estimation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Complexity: Constructing a confidence interval may involve more calculations and knowledge of probability distributions.\n",
    "    Interpretation: Interpreting confidence intervals correctly may be challenging for non-statisticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, estimation statistics involves the process of estimating unknown population parameters based on sample data. Point estimation provides a single \n",
    "value estimate of the parameter, while interval estimation provides a range of plausible values within which the true parameter value is likely to lie. \n",
    "The choice between point and interval estimation depends on the specific situation and the level of information required. Point estimates are simple and \n",
    "quick, but they lack information about precision. Interval estimates provide information about precision but may be more complex to calculate and interpret."

    "Purpose:\n",
    "    Dimensionality Reduction: \n",
    "        By downsampling the input feature maps, pooling reduces the number of parameters and computations in the network. This simplification helps\n",

    "Benefits:\n",

    "    Feature Generalization: \n",
    "        It extracts the most important features while discarding less relevant ones, aiding the network in focusing on significant patterns.\n",

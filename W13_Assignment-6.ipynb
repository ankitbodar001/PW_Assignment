    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical format. \n",
    "However, they are used in slightly different scenarios and have distinct characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "    Label Encoding involves assigning a unique numerical label to each category in a categorical variable. The labels are assigned in an arbitrary\n",
    "    manner, without considering any inherent order or ranking among the categories. This technique is suitable for categorical variables with \n",
    "    ordinal relationships, where the categories have a specific order but the intervals between them are not well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "    Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical variable has a clear ordinal relationship, meaning there is a meaningful order between the\n",
    "    categories. Each category is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the order. This technique is used when the order of categories \n",
    "    matters and there is a known hierarchy among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working on a dataset that contains information about students' academic performance, and one of the features is the \"Grade Level\"\n",
    "of the students. The \"Grade Level\" can be \"Freshman,\" \"Sophomore,\" \"Junior,\" and \"Senior,\" indicating an ordinal relationship. Here's how you might \n",
    "choose between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "    If you choose to use Ordinal Encoding, you would assign numerical values based on the order of grades. For example, \"Freshman\" might be encoded\n",
    "    as 1, \"Sophomore\" as 2, \"Junior\" as 3, and \"Senior\" as 4. This encoding captures the meaningful order of the grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "    If you choose to use Label Encoding, you would assign arbitrary numerical labels to each grade, such as \"Freshman\" as 1, \"Sophomore\" as 2, \n",
    "    \"Junior\" as 3, and \"Senior\" as 4. However, this doesn't accurately represent the ordinal nature of the grades, and the model might incorrectly \n",
    "    assume that the intervals between the labels are meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, since the \"Grade Level\" feature has a clear ordinal relationship, Ordinal Encoding would be the preferred choice. \n",
    "It accurately represents the order of the grades and ensures that the numerical values correspond to the hierarchical structure of the categories."

    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Mean Target for Each Category:\n",
    "    For each category in the categorical variable, calculate the mean of the target variable for that category. This indicates how often the target\n",

    "\n",
    "Assign Numerical Labels:\n",
    "    Assign numerical labels to the categories based on their order after sorting by mean target values. The category with the highest mean target \n",
    "    gets the highest label, and so on.\n",

    "    Assign Numerical Labels:\n",
    "        Assign numerical labels based on the order: Premium (1) < Standard (2) < Basic (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, you've encoded the subscription plans in a way that captures the relationship between the categories and \n",
    "the target variable (churn rate). This ensures that the encoded values reflect both the ordinal nature of the categories and their impact on the \n",

    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed electronically. \n",
    "It provides a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. \n",
    "Databases are used in various applications and systems to store and manage vast amounts of information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Structure: \n",
    "    SQL databases are based on a structured model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. \n",
    "    Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields) that define the data types and constraints.\n",
    "Data Integrity: \n",
    "    SQL databases enforce strong data integrity constraints, such as enforcing unique values, primary and \n",
    "    foreign key relationships, and data types. These constraints ensure data consistency and reliability.\n",
    "Query Language: \n",
    "    SQL databases use the SQL language to query and manipulate data. SQL provides a standardized way to \n",
    "    interact with the database, allowing users to retrieve, update, insert, and delete data using declarative statements.\n",
    "Scalability: \n",
    "    SQL databases can handle large amounts of structured data efficiently and are suitable for complex \n",
    "    queries involving multiple tables and relationships.\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "    MySQL, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: \n",
    "    NoSQL databases use a flexible schema model, often called \"schema-less\" or \"schema-on-read.\" Data is \n",
    "    stored in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.\n",
    "Data Flexibility: \n",
    "    NoSQL databases allow for easier scalability and data flexibility. They can handle unstructured or \n",
    "    semi-structured data, making them suitable for storing and retrieving large amounts of data with varying structures.\n",
    "Query Language: \n",
    "    NoSQL databases often have their own query languages or APIs that are specific to their data model. \n",
    "    These query languages are designed to handle the particular data structure and characteristics of the database.\n",
    "Scalability: \n",
    "    NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data distributed across multiple \n",
    "    servers or nodes. They are designed to scale horizontally, making them suitable for high-volume and \n",
    "    high-velocity data.\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "    MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application or system. \n",
    "SQL databases are well-suited for structured and relational data, transactional consistency, and complex queries. \n",
    "NoSQL databases excel in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, high scalability, and flexible schemas. \n",

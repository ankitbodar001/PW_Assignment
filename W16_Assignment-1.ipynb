    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. \n",
    "It is a popular choice due to its simplicity and interpretability. Decision trees work by recursively partitioning the data into subsets \n",
    "based on the values of input features, ultimately leading to the prediction of a target class or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how a decision tree classifier algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The process begins with the entire dataset, which includes input features and corresponding target labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The algorithm selects the best feature from the dataset to split the data into subsets. The selected feature is the one that results in\n",
    "    the best separation or information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dataset is split into subsets based on the selected feature. Each subset corresponds to a unique value or range of values for the \n",
    "    chosen feature. For example, if the feature is \"age,\" subsets could be \"age < 30\" and \"age >= 30.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The algorithm repeats the process recursively for each subset created in the previous step. It continues to select the best feature to \n",
    "    split the data and creates sub-subsets accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The recursion continues until one of the stopping criteria is met. Common stopping criteria include:\n",
    "        Maximum tree depth: Limiting the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "        Minimum number of samples per leaf node: Ensuring that each leaf node has a minimum number of samples.\n",
    "        Maximum number of leaf nodes: Limiting the total number of leaf nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once the recursion stops, the leaf nodes of the decision tree are assigned class labels. For classification tasks, each leaf node is \n",
    "    assigned the class label that is most prevalent among the samples in that leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    To make predictions for new, unseen data, the input features are passed down the tree, and the decision tree classifier follows the path\n",
    "    through the tree nodes based on the feature values. Eventually, it arrives at a leaf node, which provides the predicted class label for \n",
    "    the input data.\n",
    "    The key concept behind decision trees is to divide the feature space into smaller, more homogenous regions with respect to the target \n",
    "    variable. This partitioning is based on the feature values that provide the most discriminatory information for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Decision Tree Classifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Easy to understand and interpret, making them suitable for explaining decisions to non-technical users.\n",
    "    Capable of handling both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "    Non-parametric and can capture complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "    Naturally handle missing values and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Decision Tree Classifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prone to overfitting, especially if the tree is deep and complex.\n",
    "    Can be sensitive to small variations in the training data.\n",
    "    May not perform as well as other algorithms on some datasets.\n",
    "    Limited expressiveness for modeling certain types of relationships (e.g., XOR).\n",

    "\n",
    "    Entropy(S)=−(p+)*(log2(p+))−(p-)*(log2(p-))\n",

    "Step 2: Building the Decision Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The decision tree classifier algorithm starts by selecting a feature from the dataset to split on. It chooses the feature that maximizes\n",
    "    the \"information gain\" or minimizes \"impurity\" (e.g., entropy or Gini impurity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Splitting the Data:\n",

    "    that leaf node is labeled as \"Yes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Making Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    To make predictions for new, unseen data, you start at the root node of the decision tree and follow the path down the tree based on the \n",

    "\n",
    "One-vs-Rest (OvR) or One-vs-All (OvA) Approach:\n",

    "\n",
    "    Training: For each classifier, you treat one class as the \"positive\" class, and the rest of the classes are considered the \"negative\" class.\n",
    "    You train each classifier independently using binary logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prediction: When you want to classify a new instance, you apply each of the classifiers to the input data. The classifier that produces the\n",

    "Softmax Regression (Multinomial Logistic Regression) Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The softmax regression approach is a more direct method for multiclass classification. It models the probability distribution over all \n",

    "\n",
    "    Training: In this approach, you use a modified version of the logistic function called the softmax function (or the normalized exponential) \n",
